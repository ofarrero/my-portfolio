                My name is Róisín. I am a computer engineering student in Trinity College Dublin going
                into third year. I choose to study engineering as I was unsure what area of STEM I wanted
                to go into as I enjoyed multiple areas. The first two years of my degree were general, this 
                enabled me to study many different areas. I got a great grounding in maths, chemistry and physics.
                As an engineering student a lot of emphasis during my first two years were also put on design. 
                We learnt about the universal principles of design and completed many design based projects.

               During the summer of my first year in college I got the opportunity to do an internship in Intel.
               It was during this internship that I decided that I wanted to study compunter engineering as I 
               really enjoyed the work that I was doing. I was introduced to the fundamentals of
               object oriented programming and over the course of the internship I had the opportunity to implement 
               what I had learnt in projects. My capstone project was working on an internal application for the 
               creating and streamlining of qualification plans. My main role duting this project was to create an 
               xml tag parser to sort user input and the creation of the output document.

                I contibute the person not only to what I have done and what I'm interested in but also to the 
                people in my life. If it wasn't for the influece of my parents I doubt I would be where I am today.
                My father is one of my biggest role models. He is a Data Analyst with a love for technology. Looking up
                to him as a child I wanted to do what he was doing and always wanted him to tell me about what he was 
                doing. I think it is because of this that I became so interested in STEM. He encouraged me to take courses
                in different STEM subjects and always told me I was capable. My mother was another huge influence in my life.
                She is not working in a STEM field, she is a librarian. Having a mother that worked when I was younger was 
                such a positive influence. I got to see a woman work hard and work her way up the command chain to where she is 
                now. She taught me a lot about hard work and dedication but also about taking time for yourself and its importance.
                Someone who had a great influenece on me that is not a member of my family is my mentor from my internship at 
                Intel, Chris. Chris guided me through my first internship and he was incredible. He showed me that work isn't 
                just about working it's also about the friendships you make and the positive environment you create. He taught
                me how easy it is to encourage and build people up. It is these lessons from my internship that have resonated with
                me the most.

                My entire personality isn't computer engineering, I have many other interests. I really enjoy sport. I played centre
                for my college netball team over the last year. I decided to try netball out as it was a fast paced tactical
                game and I really enjoyed my time on the team but I think next year I might try out another sport. I also really enjoy
                running and swimming so I am thinking about joining the triathalon team for the next academic year. Triathalon requires
                dedication and hard work traits which I would love to improve upon. I also have a huge interest in music in particular
                I love musicals. Seeing musicals on stage is really incredible, recently I went to London to see Hamilton in the West End 
                It was amazing and I would definitely reccommend going to see it. I also really enjoy concerts, I was meant to see the KIllers 
                but due to Covid-19 the concert was postponed to next summer so I am going to have to wait another year to see them :(
